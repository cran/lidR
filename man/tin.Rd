\usage{
tin(..., extrapolate = knnidw(3, 1, 50))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{unused}

\item{extrapolate}{There are usually a few points outside the convex hull, determined by the ground
points at the very edge of the dataset, that cannot be interpolated with a triangulation.
Extrapolation is done using the nearest neighbour approach by default using \link{knnidw}.}
}
\description{
This function is made to be used in \link{grid_terrain} or \link{normalize_height}. It implements an algorithm
for spatial interpolation. Spatial interpolation is based on a Delaunay triangulation, which performs
a linear interpolation within each triangle. There are usually a few points outside the convex hull,
determined by the ground points at the very edge of the dataset, that cannot be interpolated with
a triangulation. Extrapolation is done using the nearest neighbour approach.
