\title{Set or get number of threads that lidR should use}
\usage{
set_lidr_threads(threads)

get_lidr_threads()
}
\arguments{
\item{threads}{An integer >= 0. Default 0 means use all CPU available and leave the operating system
to multi task.}
}
\description{
Set and get number of threads to be used in lidR functions that are parallelized with OpenMP.
Default value 0 means to utilize all CPU available. \code{get_lidr_threads()} returns the number
of threads that will be used. This affects \code{lidR} package but also the \code{data.table} package
by internally calling \link[data.table:setDTthreads]{setDTthreads} because several functions  of
lidR rely on \code{data.table} but it does not change R itself or other packages using OpenMP.
