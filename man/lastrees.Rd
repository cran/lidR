\usage{
lastrees(.las, algorithm, image = NULL, ..., extra = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.las}{An object of the class \code{LAS}}

\item{algorithm}{character. The name of an algorithm. Can be \code{"dalponte2016"},
\code{"watershed"} or \code{"li2012"} (see sections relevant to each algorithm).}

\item{image}{RasterLayer. Image of the canopy if the algorithm works on a canopy surface model.
But some algorithms work on the raw point cloud (see relevant sections). You can compute
it with \link{grid_canopy} or read it from external file.}

\item{...}{parameters for the algorithms. These depend on the algorithm used (see details about the algorithms)}

\item{extra}{logical. By default the function works at the point cloud level and returns nothing.
If \code{extra = TRUE} the function can return a \link[raster:raster]{RasterLayer} or a list of 2 RasterLayers
with the positions of the local maxima and a map of the crowns, depending on the algorithm used.}
}
\value{
Nothing, the point cloud is updated by reference. If \code{extra = TRUE},
\code{"dalponte2012"} returns two RasterLayers, \code{"watershed"} returns one RasterLayer
and \code{"Li2012"} does not support the \code{extra} parameter.
}
\description{
Individual tree segmentation with several possible algorithms (see details). The function
attributes to each point of the point cloud a number identifying the detected tree
the point comes from (\code{treeID} column). By default the classification is done at the
point level. However, with some algorithms it is possible to return a raster image of the
classification. There are currently 3 algorithms implemented. See relevant sections.
}
\section{Dalponte 2016}{


This is the algorithm developed by Dalponte and Coomes (see references). This algorithm exists
in the package \pkg{itcSegment}. This version is identical to the original but with
superfluous code removed and rewritten in pure C++. Consequently it is 6 times faster.
Note that this algorithm strictly performs a segmentation while the original method as implemented
in \code{itcSegment} and described in the manuscript also performs a pre- and post-process when
these tasks are expected to be done by the user.
The names of the parameters are the same as those in Dalponte's \code{itcSegment} package.
Dalponte's algorithm is a canopy surface model-based method. An image of the canopy is
expected.
\describe{
\item{\code{searchWinSize}}{Size (in pixels) of the moving window used to the detect the
local maxima. It should be an odd number larger than 3. Default 3}
\item{\code{TRESHSeed}}{Growing threshold 1. It should be between 0 and 1. Default 0.45}
\item{\code{TRESHCrown}}{Growing threshold 2. It should be between 0 and 1. Default 0.55}
\item{\code{DIST}}{Maximum value of the crown diameter of a detected tree (in meters). Default 10}
\item{\code{th}}{Digital number value below which a pixel cannot be a local maxima. Default 2}
}
}

\section{Watershed}{


This method relies on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)}{watershed segmentation}
method. It is based on the bioconductor package \pkg{EBIimage}. You need to install
this package to run this method (see its \href{https://github.com/aoles/EBImage}{github page}).
The Watershed algorithm is a canopy surface model-based method. An image of the canopy is
expected.
\describe{
\item{\code{th}}{Numeric. Number value below which a pixel cannot be a crown. Default 2}
\item{\code{tolerance}}{Numeric. see ?EBImage::watershed}
\item{\code{ext}}{Numeric. see ?EBImage::watershed}
}
}

\section{Li 2012}{


This method is an implementation of the Li et al. (see references) algorithm made by \pkg{lidR}
author. It may have some differences compared with the original method due to potential  mis-interpretation
of the Li et al. manuscript. This method works at the point cloud level. An
image of the canopy is \emph{not} expected.
\describe{
\item{\code{dt1}}{Numeric. Threshold number 1. See reference page 79. Default is 1.5}
\item{\code{dt2}}{Numeric. Threshold number 2. See reference page 79. Default is 2}
\item{\code{R}}{Numeric. Maximum radius of a crown. Any value greater than a crown is
good because this parameter does not affect the result. However, it greatly affects the
computation speed. The lower the value, the faster the method. Default is 10.}
}
The current implementation is known to be slow. Improvements are possible in future
package versions.
