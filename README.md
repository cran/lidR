R package for Airborne LiDAR Data Manipulation and Visualization for Forestry Applications

The lidR package provides functions to read and write `.las` and `.laz` files, plot point clouds, compute metrics using an area-based approach, compute digital canopy models, thin lidar data, manage a catalog of datasets, automatically extract ground inventories, process a set of tiles using multicore processing, individual tree segmentation, classify data from geographic data, and provides other tools to manipulate LiDAR data in a research and development context.

* Development of the `lidR` package between 2015 and 2018 was made possible thanks to the financial support of the [AWARE project  (NSERC CRDPJ 462973-14)](http://aware.forestry.ubc.ca/); grantee [Prof Nicholas Coops](http://profiles.forestry.ubc.ca/person/nicholas-coops/).
* Development of the `lidR` package between 2018 and 2019 was made possible thanks to the financial support of the Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs of Québec.

# Key features

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/point-cloud-rotating.gif">

### Read and display a las file

In R-fashion style the function `plot`, based on `rgl`, enables the user to display, rotate and zoom a point cloud. Because `rgl` has limited capabilities with respect to large datasets, we also made a package [PointCloudViewer](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/PointCloudViewer) with greater display capabilities.

```r
las <- readLAS("<file.las>")
plot(las)
```

### Compute a canopy height model

<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/chm-Khosravipour.png">

`lidR` has several algorithms from the literature to compute canopy height models either point-to-raster based or triangulation based. This allows testing and comparison of some methods that rely on a CHM, such as individual tree segmentation or the computation of a canopy roughness index.

```r
las <- readLAS("<file.las>")

# Khosravipour et al. pitfree algorithm
thr <- c(0,2,5,10,15)
edg <- c(0, 1.5)
chm <- grid_canopy(las, 1, pitfree(thr, edg))

plot(chm)
```

### Read and display a catalog of las files

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/catalog-plot_interactive.gif">

`lidR` enables the user to manage, use and process a catalog of `las` files. The function `catalog` builds a `LAScatalog` object from a folder. The function `plot` displays this catalog on an interactive map using the `mapview` package (if installed).

```r
ctg <- catalog("<folder/>")
plot(ctg, map = TRUE)
```

From a `LAScatalog` object the user can (for example) extract some regions of interest (ROI) with `lasclip`. Using a catalog for the extraction of the ROI guarantees fast and memory-efficient clipping. `LAScatalog` objects allow many other manipulations that can be done with multicore processing, where possible.

### Individual tree segmentation

<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/its-rotating-tree-segmented.gif" margin-right="5px">

The `lastrees` function has several algorithms from the literature for individual tree segmentation, based either on the digital canopy model or on the point-cloud. Each algorithm has been coded from the source article to be as close as possible to what was written in the peer-reviewed papers. Our goal is to make published algorithms usable, testable and comparable.

```r
las <- readLAS("<file.las>")

las <- lastrees(las, li2012())
col <- random.colors(200)
plot(las, color = "treeID", colorPalette = col)
```

### Wall-to-wall dataset processing

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-Romain/storage/master/README/catalog-processing.gif">

Most of the lidR functions can process seamlessly a set of tiles and return a continuous output. Users can create their own methods using the LAScatalog processing engine via the `catalog_apply` function. Among other features the engine takes advantage of point indexation with lax files, takes care of processing tiles with a buffer and allows for processing big files that do not fit in memory.

```r
# Load a LAScatalog instead of a LAS file
ctg <- catalog("<path/to/folder/>")

# Process it like a LAS file
chm <- grid_canopy(ctg, 2, p2r())
col <- random.colors(50)
plot(chm, col = col)
```

### Other tools

`lidR` has many other tools and is a continuously improved package. If it does not exist in `lidR` please ask us for a new feature, and depending on the feasibility we will be glad to implement your requested feature.
