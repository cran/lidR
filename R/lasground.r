#' Classify points as ground or not ground
#'
#' Implements a Progressive Morphological Filter for segmentation of ground points.
#' The function updates the field \code{Classification} of the input LAS obect. The points
#' classified as 'ground' are assigned a value of 2 according to las specifications (See the ASPRS
#' documentation for the
#' \href{http://www.asprs.org/a/society/committees/standards/LAS_1_4_r13.pdf}{LAS file format}).
#' This function is an implementation of the Zhang et al. (2003) algorithm (see reference)
#'
#' @param .las a LAS object
#' @param MaxWinSize numeric. Maximum window size to be used in filtering ground returns (see references)
#' @param Slope  numeric. Slope value to be used in computing the height thresholds (see references)
#' @param InitDist numeric. Initial height above the parameterized ground surface to be considered a ground return (see references)
#' @param MaxDist numeric. Maximum height above the parameterized ground surface to be considered a ground return (see references)
#' @param CellSize numeric. Cell size
#' @param ... Any additional specific parameters to be passed to the progressive morphological filter.
#' These include:\cr
#' - \code{exponential} logical. Default is TRUE.\cr
#' - \code{base} numeric. Default is 2\cr
#' @return Nothing. The original LAS object is updated by reference. In the 'Classification'
#' column a value of 2 denotes ground according to LAS specifications.
