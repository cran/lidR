#' Algorithms for shape detection of the local point neighborhood
#'
#' These functions are made to be used in \link{lasdetectshape}. They implement algorithms for local
#' neighborhood shape estimation.
#'
#' In the following, \eqn{a1, a2, a3} denote the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the neighbouring
#' points in ascending order. \eqn{th1, th2, th3} denote a set of threshold values. Points are labelled
#' \code{TRUE} if they meet the following criteria. \code{FALSE} otherwise.\cr
#' \describe{
#' \item{shp_plane}{Detection of plans based on criteria defined by Limberger & Oliveira (2015) (see references).
#' A point is labelled TRUE if the neighborhood is approximately planar, that is: \deqn{a2 > (th1*a1) and (th2*a2) > a3}}
#' \item{shp_hplane}{The same as 'plane' but with an extra test on the orientation of the Z vector
#' of the principal components to test the horizontality of the surface.  \deqn{a2 > (th1*a1) and (th2*a2) > a3 and |Z| > th3}
#' In theory |Z| should be exactly equal to 1. In practice 0.98 or 0.99 should be fine}
#' \item{shp_line}{Detection of lines inspired by the Limberger & Oliveira (2015) criterion. A point is
#' labelled TRUE if the neighborhood is approximately linear, that is: \deqn{th1*a2 < a3 and th1*a1 < a3}}
#' }
#'
#' @param th1,th2,th3 numeric. Threshold values (see details)
#' @param k integer. Number of neighbours used to estimate the neighborhood.
