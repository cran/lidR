#' A very fast 2D concave hull algorithm for a set of points
#'
#' The algorithm is based on ideas from Park and Oh (2012). A first implementation in
#' JavaScript was proposed by Vladimir Agafonkin in \href{https://github.com/mapbox/concaveman}{mapbox}.
#' This implementation dramatically improved performance over the one stated in the paper
#' using a spatial index. The algorithm was then ported to R by JoÃ«l Gombin in the R package
#' \href{https://github.com/joelgombin/concaveman}{concaveman} that runs the JavaScript
#' implementation proposed by Vladimir Agafonkin. Later a C++ version of Vladimir Agafonkin's
#' JavaScript implementation was proposed by Stanislaw Adaszewski in
#' \href{https://github.com/sadaszewski/concaveman-cpp}{concaveman-cpp}. This concaveman
#' function uses Stanislaw Adaszewski's C++ code making the concaveman algorithm an
#' order of magnitude (up to 50 times) faster than the Javascript version.
#'
#' @param x,y coordinate vectors of points. This can be specified as two vectors x and y, a 2-column
#' matrix x, a list with two components, etc.
#' @param concavity numeric a relative measure of concavity. 1 results in a relatively detailed shape,
#' Infinity results in a convex hull. You can use values lower than 1, but they can produce pretty crazy
#' shapes.
#' @param length_threshold numeric. When a segment length is under this threshold, it stops being
#' considered for further detailed processing. Higher values result in simpler shapes.
